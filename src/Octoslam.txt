***Pseudo code for the scan registration***
function Match (LaserScan::constPtr scan, vector currentPose, int iterations)
    T = pose (gonna be a vector with 6 values)
    vector scan3 = scan transform -> vector of octomath::vector3
    for 0 to iterations:
        H = new matrix (3 x 3)
        det = new vector (3 x 1)-> I think
        for 0 to scan.size:
            d = scan3.get(i)-> vector3
            find voxels
            M = mapValues(with voxels)
            H = H->first part of eq. 29 (this will be new value that will be added to the sum)
            det = det->second part of 29 (ditto)
        t = T + (H * det)

    return T
